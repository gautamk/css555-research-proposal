\section{Software Maintenance and Maintainability}
Software maintenance as defined by the International Organization for Standardization is the process of modifying a software product after delivery to correct faults or to improve any quality attributes \cite{_international_2006} \\

Maintainability is a quality attribute that describes the ease of introducing modifications into the software systems. Maintainability has four sub-characteristics namely analysability, changeability, stability and testability\cite{_international_2006}.\\

\subsection{Types of Maintenance}
ISO defines four types of software maintenance, Corrective, Preventive, Adaptive and Perfective. \\

Corrective maintenance refers to modifications done fix actual errors in the product while preventive maintenance is performed to introduce changes that can potentially prevent problems during the normal operation of the software product. \\

Adaptive and perfective maintenance are modifications introduced to enhance the core functionality of the software by improving one or more of its quality attributes. 

\section{Quantifying Maintainability}
Understanding maintainability as a quality attribute is useful in learning the benefits of  its presence in a product but to derive value from the process of evaluating software maintainability we require a method of measuring maintainability as a metric.

\subsection{UML based metrics}
One way to measure maintainability is to analyse the class diagram. This is especially useful in projects which use an object oriented programming language and have an existing UML diagram describing the software structure. \\


Genero et al \cite{genero_building_2003} \cite{genero_building_2007} describe an elegant way of predicting the maintainability of software early in the design phase by measuring the size and structural complexity of the software project. \\

UML based metrics cannot independently describe the maintainability of a system because they suffer from the same basic flaw that UML adoption faces. The fact that UML isn't as widely adopted in the software industry is the primary limiting factor. Though UML is extremely well defined and documented its complexity and the learning curve needed to effectively adopt UML in an organisation setting serves as a serious impediment to its adoption which in-turn reduces the value of using an UML based metric in measuring the maintainability of a software architecture.

\subsection{Coupling as a metric}

Coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules \cite{_international_2006}. Low coupling is often associated with high readability and maintainability because data and control flow often tends to be well structured in systems with low coupling.\\

Lindvall et al define\cite{lindvall_empirically-based_2003} metrics to evaluate the maintainability of a software architecture based on the degree of coupling between modules in the software system. The metrics defined by the authors are
\begin{enumerate}
\item CBM coupling-between-modules
\item CBMC coupling-between-module-classes
\item CIM coupling inside a module
\end{enumerate}

\say{CBM} is defined as the number of non-directional, distinct, inter-module references. Similarly \say{CBMC} is the number of non-directional, distinct, inter-module, class-to-class references for a module.

The goal when constructing a software architecture is to reduce Inter module dependencies (CBM and CBMC) at the expense of increasing intra module dependencies. Conversely when comparing architectures the one with lower CBM and CBMC scores are better.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Related quality attributes}
Maintainability has a positive relationship with availability, flexibility, reliability, testability and a negative relationship with efficiency \cite{karl_software_2003}. This means that an increase in flexibility, for example, could potentially improve the maintainability of the software system. An increase in efficiency could potentially hamper maintainability.\\

Understanding these trade off is important because indirect measurements as a factor of one of the aforementioned quality attributes can play a critical role when direct measurements of maintainability aren't available.

\section{Further reading}

\begin{itemize}
\item Maintaining Maintainability \cite{ramage_maintaining_1998}\\
In this paper the authors attempt to quantify the effects of people, organisation and the maintenance process as a metric to evaluate how these external factors affect maintainability in a software system.

\item Software Architecture Evaluation Methods for Performance, Maintainability, Testability, and Portability \cite{mattsson_software_2006}\\
This paper is a meta analysis of various methods of software architecture evaluation for to quantify quality attributes such as Performance, Testability, Maintainability and portability.
